# PyProgramSoliMoisturePrediction
This Python program is used for predictive analytics estimation of the river flows in Serbia. This code applies Mann - Kendall test which works for all distributions to analyze time series data for trends. If there is no trend, then probability value p is greater than 0.05, otherwise, there is a trend in time series with significant level (p-value) less or equal than 0.05 and trend could be positive or negative. 

With respect to Mann-Kendall test, the Theil-Sen estimator is used to calculate trend intercept and slope. For this purpose is used `pyMannkendal` package.


## Input datasets

The Excel table includes columns detailing measurements from a meteorological station situated near Novi Sad, Serbia. This weather station features an extensive array of sensors. The sensors quantify six features, which correspond to variables in an Excel data frame: SM1 (soil moisture), AT1 (air temperature), AH1 (air humidity), WS1 (wind speed), WD1 (wind direction), and PP1 (precipitation). The Excel spreadsheet is excluded from this repository due to data protection considerations.


## Dependencies

- [pandas]
- [sklearn]
- [xgboost]
- [optuna]
- [matplotlib.pyplot]
- [statsmodels]
- [seaborn]
- [os]


## Workmates
